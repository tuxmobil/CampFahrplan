# CampFahrplan

CampFahrplan is a viewer for schedules of [Chaos Computer Club e.V. events][ccc-events]
such as Chaos Communication Camp or Chaos Communication Congress.

In addition to an daily overview of talks, the app lets you read the abstracts,
highlight talks, add a talk to your calendar, share talks with others, and
set reminders within the app.

Moreover, the app is designed to consume schedule data published in a specific
format as provided by [Pentabarf][pentabarf] or its successor [Frab][frab].
Therefore, the app can be re-deployed for other events using the same schedule
file format.


## Release build / signing

Before you can run a release build for your product flavor
please create a `gradle.properties` file in the `app` module.
A template file is provided which contains the required settings -
see [`app/gradle.properties.example`](app/gradle.properties.example).


## Contributing

Contributions can be served as contextual atomic branches which should
be rebased onto the current `HEAD` of the `master` branch. Please make
sure to apply [automatic code formatting and organize imports][code-formatting]
as it is provided by Android Studio and IntelliJ. To automate this a
*checkstyle* definition will be provided in the near future.
